```
https://your-agent-url.blink.host/daily-news
```

You can automate this with:
- GitHub Actions scheduled workflows
- Cron jobs
- Cloud scheduler services (AWS EventBridge, Google Cloud Scheduler, etc.)

### Slack App Configuration

- `groups:history`
- `im:history`
- `im:write`
- `assistant:write` (for status updates)

## Output Format

Each daily summary includes:

```
Top articles for today, [date]:

1. **"Article Title"**
*Publication â€“ Author*
https://article-url.com
Brief summary of the article.

**Pillar(s):** [Relevant pillars]
**Trend Signal:** [Social sharing/cultural moment notes]
**Cross-Platform:** [LinkedIn/Instagram/TikTok engagement]
**Strategic Insight:**
- Why it matters for FQ community
- How it could inspire discussion
```

## Content Discovery Strategy

### Credible News Sources
The agent searches only from these verified outlets:
- **Major newspapers:** NYT, WSJ, Washington Post, The Guardian
- **News agencies:** Reuters, AP, NPR, BBC
- **Business outlets:** Forbes, Fortune, Bloomberg, Business Insider, HBR
- **Quality analysis:** The Atlantic, New Yorker, Vox, Axios, Politico, Time, The Economist

### Search Strategy
The agent runs multiple targeted searches to maximize relevant content:
- Searches each FQ pillar topic individually (e.g., "women workplace equality", "women's health policy")
- Searches general trending topics (e.g., "women leadership news")
- Defaults to articles published in the last 7 days
- Returns 15 results per search for a larger pool after deduplication

## Article Deduplication

- Articles are tracked by URL in persistent storage
- Once shared, an article will **never** be shared again
- Storage persists across agent restarts and deployments
- No expiration (articles remain blocked permanently)

## Usage

### Run the agent
```bash
blink dev
```

### Trigger a daily summary
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-agent-url.blink.host/daily-news
```

### Interact in Slack
- @mention the bot in any channel
- Send a direct message
- The bot will respond helpfully to questions about articles or FQ topics
